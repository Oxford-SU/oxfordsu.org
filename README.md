# oxfordsu.org

This is the Github repository for Oxford SU's digital systems.

Oxford SU delivers a wide range of services to its members, and the majority of those services rely in some way on a digital system - usually delivered as part of the SU's website and underlying membership management system.

### Documentation

Docs for the SU's digital systems can be found in the wiki. These docs are for staff and student officers, to aid in their administration of student-facing services.

- Volunteering
- Find my Rep
- Student Council
- Elections and referenda

### Resources

Files, code snippets and templates are kept in the Code section of this repository. 

- The definitive CSS files for the website
- Code snippets for accordions
- An archive of templates and files that are no longer in use

### Development roadmap
