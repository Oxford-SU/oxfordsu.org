# oxfordsu.org

This is the Github repository for Oxford SU's digital systems.

Oxford SU delivers a wide range of services to its members, and the majority of those services rely in some way on a digital system - usually delivered as part of the SU's website and underlying membership management system.

### Documentation

Docs for the SU's digital systems can be found in the wiki.

It contains:

- Commented and tidied-up CSS files
- A wiki for staff to use when updating and expanding the website
- Definitive versions of reusable code snippets, such as the Javascript for accordions
- Guides of how functions are deployed and how they can be maintained
- Archived versions of old page HTML and code snippets

### Development roadmap

Primarily focused on our website, [oxfordsu.org](https://www.oxfordsu.org/), this repository also hosts our [Digital roadmap](https://github.com/users/Oxford-SU/projects/2) - an evolving list of feature developments and ideas.
